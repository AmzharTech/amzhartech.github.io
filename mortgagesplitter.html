    The Mortgage Split Calculator is a tool that helps couples or individuals divide their mortgage payments based on their individual incomes. By inputting your respective salaries, the calculator determines the percentage of the mortgage each person should pay.
  </p>
  <p>
    The calculator takes into account the monthly salaries of both parties and the total mortgage amount, then calculates the percentage of the mortgage each person should contribute. This helps to ensure that the payments are divided fairly and in a way that is proportionate to each person's income.
  </p>
  <p>
    To use the Mortgage Split Calculator, simply input your respective monthly salaries and the total mortgage amount. The calculator will then display the recommended split percentage for each person. This makes it easy to split the mortgage in a fair and equitable way that takes into account each person's income level.
